# Spatial Data Projects

This repository contains spatial and statistical data analysis work completed
using R, RStudio, and spatial statistics tools. The projects focus on applying
statistical methods to spatial and non-spatial datasets and clearly documenting
analytical results.

The work is organized to separate analysis code from finalized reports for
clarity and readability.

## Repository Structure

### R-RStudio
This folder contains R and R Markdown files used for data processing, exploratory
analysis, statistical testing, and basic spatial operations.

Typical tasks include:
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical testing and modeling
- Plotting and visualization
- Introductory spatial operations

Files may include both `.Rmd` source files and exported PDF outputs.

### Spatial-Data-Reports
This folder contains finalized PDF reports documenting statistical and spatial
analysis projects. Each report presents the analytical workflow, results, and
interpretation.

Topics covered include:
- Probability distributions
- Sampling techniques
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing
- Correlation and regression
- Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
- Spatial autocorrelation (GeoDa)
